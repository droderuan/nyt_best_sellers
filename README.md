# Welcome to NY Times Best Sellers

Hi there, welcome to my React project, using next.js, for listing the best sellers book at New York Times.
My intend to this project is to show my hability use the React core conceptions and follow a mature code design.

## What to expect

You can expect a good and responsive design, as well with a good UX. I have a strong thinking of clean code, so I'm always triying to create code that is easy and elegant to read.
The main functionality is to save a book list and, every time you access the page, the app can check when a list had a update. Showing new books or a books that went out.

## Getting Started

You need to clone this repo and install all the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/droderuan/nyt_best_sellers.git
```

```bash
cd ./nyt_best_sellers && npm i
```

After run the commands above, you can start the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Why Next.Js if SPA was asked?

I decided to go with Next.Js for two main reasons:

- Despite beign a SSR framework, Next.Js allows to create SPA application.
- Next.Js gainned a lot of popularity and proved to be a very good solution on SEO and in overall performance.
